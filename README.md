# wpa-password-writer
Writes the SSID and password to the wpa_supplicant.conf file

It is recommend that you'll add a space before running the script so command doesn't save in the history with the password
To do this, you'll need to add change HISTCONTROL to be equal to HISTCONTROL=ignorespace in the ~/.bashrc file
